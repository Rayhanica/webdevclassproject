        <p>Just Cause 4 is my favorite game overall due to the high speed mobility of the character, which makes the game super demanding at the moment of having adventurous moments.
        You have the freedom of flying through the inmense map, as you also can drive all types of vehivles that you can possibly imagine. The game has also a huge variety of guns,
        missions and also is packed with different side quests that make the game not look repetitive nor boring at no point.</p>
